# MEAL-Survey

I recently conducted a short survey via Linkedin groups to gather insights on how to start and develop a career in MEAL/M&E.

Participation was unfortunately limited, making the results non-generalizable. Some redundancies and overlaps were also present in the questionnaire design. However, despite these limitations, the responses provide useful reflections for anyone considering this career path.

Key takeaways:
• Most respondents hold degrees in Social Sciences, Economics/Business, or Environmental/Climate Studies.
• Jobs are mainly found through online platforms, recruiters, and direct contact with organizations.
• Networking is considered crucial — both for securing a first job and for career progression.
• Entry opportunities appear more accessible in small NGOs and local organizations.
• Strong technical skills in data analysis, statistics, and data visualization are increasingly important.

The challenges reported highlight the need to develop both technical expertise (data analysis, data quality management, understanding frameworks) and transferable skills, while maintaining a solid grasp of the broader project and program context in which MEAL operates.

Continuous learning is essential — often through self-learning — given the limited availability of structured mentoring, even though mentorship is widely recognized as valuable when accessible.
